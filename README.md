  <p align="center">
    Instrument Match is a unique take on an AirBnB clone for the gigging musician on the go. This application includes a rental and booking database for any musical instrument you might want to...or need to rent! You can browse instruments via search by instrument family, name, and location (with a Google Maps API integration). Users can make sure they are getting a great, reliable instrument before they book by reading reviews, viewing when it was last serviced, and seeing each instrument's average "Musical Note" 5-star rating. Once you book a rental, you can also add your own review and rating. If you decide to change you mind, you can cancel your rental as long as it is before the rental start date.

## Obstacles

### Rating API

We noticed that we needed to calculate the user rating for each game in a number of places, so we decided it would be best to implement a calcRating helper function. This allows us to keep our code clean and precise.

Helper Function (calcRating):

### User Game Status Persistance

Depending on how a user has a specific game categorized in their game center, we wanted the chosen (red) status button to persist when they navigate to and from that specific game page. This required figuring out a solution to prevent the previous game status from persisting after the user had changed that status.
